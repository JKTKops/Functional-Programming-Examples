-- We can think of a functor as a way of putting values into a context
-- where it makes sense to apply functions to values in that context.
-- For example, the context of a list is a context of having multiple (0 or more)
-- values. With Maybe, the context is having 0 or 1 values. 
-- There are other contexts too; the Tree type further down the page has a
-- context of structure.
